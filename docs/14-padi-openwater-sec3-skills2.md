## Deep water entry - seated back roll
* Used when close to water
* Steps
	- Enter with your BCD partially inflated, holding your mask and breathing from your regulator.
	- Tuck your chin toward your chest.
	- Lean backward until your weight rolls you in.
	- After you’re stable on the surface, signal you’re okay (assuming you are) and clear the area so your buddy(ies) can enter.
## Remove and replace weights at the surface
* Important for adjusting weight in the water
* Steps
	- The technique varies with equipment – your instructor will help you.
	- Be careful not to drop the weights.
	- Give your weights to someone, put them on a platform or secure them to a line.
	- Be sure you have enough buoyancy and breathe from your regulator before taking weights handed to you.
	- It is best if buddies put weights on one at a time, so they can assist each other if necessary.
	- With most integrated weight systems, you remove the weights as you would in an emergency weight drop. You replace them the same way you install them when setting up your kit, but with some types you may have to remove and replace the entire kit.
	- With many systems, it helps to tilt back in the water, almost face up, so the weight pockets tend to slide into place.
	- When removing a standard nylon web belt, be sure to hold the free end and release the buckle end so the weights can’t slide off.
## Cramp release
* Painful, involuntary muscle contractions
* Key points
	- If you have or start to have a cramp, signal your buddy and stop.
	- Allow the muscle to rest. It may help to gently stretch and massage the cramped muscle.
	- After relieving a cramp, rest for a few minutes before continuing at a slower pace.
	- Dehydration, cold, restricted circulation and working a muscle beyond its fitness level can all cause cramping.
## Neutral bouyancy
* Use breath control to fine-tune your buoyancy. If you start to rise a bit, exhale and breathe with a slightly lower lung volume. If you start to sink, inhale and breathe with a slightly higher lung volume for a moment.
* If you can’t hover by adjusting with breathing, make small adjustments to your BCD.
## Fine tuning trim
* Trim is important for streamline
* Relax in midwater to check your natural position.
* Usually, you want trim for a normal swimming position.
* You want to feel balanced and stable, both side to side and front to back.
* Your instructor will help you reposition gear and weight for good trim.
* You will learn to fine-tune your trim from one dive to the next.
* Ask your instructor about the PADI Peak Performance Buoyancy course to learn more about mastering buoyancy and trim.
## Air depletion/Alternate air source 
* Simulates how it feels and how to respond to out-of-air-emergency
* Signal "out of air" or "share air"
* On surface, practice manual inflation of BCD because LPI is not available in an out-of-air emergency
* Keep using the alternate air source until bouyant
## Controlled emergency swimming ascent
* Take a breath and exhale it continuously making a loud “ahhhhh” sound as you swim no faster than 18 metres/60 feet per minute for at least 9 metres/30 feet (a 30-second swim).
