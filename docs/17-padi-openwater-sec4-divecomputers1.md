## Introduction
* Mathematical models are used to estimate Nitrogen concentration in diver's body to manage the risk of DCS.
* Available on dive computers or dive tables like the Recreational Dive Planner (table or eRDPML electronic table versions)
## How dive computers and tables work
* Dive computers and dive tables work by using your dive time and depth information to calculate the theoretical amount of nitrogen in your body
* Dive computers measure depth and time throughout a dive (and after) and apply the information to the decompression model electronically. A computer constantly updates the theoretical nitrogen in your body based on your dive depths and time, and compares it to the model
* Dive computers have become the most common method of calculating decompression information
* Depth from a depth gauge and the time from a timer used to look up limit information on the RDP Table 
* The eRDPML is a calculator-format electronic dive table. You enter your depth/time information, and it looks it up on the table for you
* Decompression models are highly reliable, but they cannot account for individual variations in physiology, such as the secondary factors you learned in the last subsection
* Do not ascend faster than 18m / 60ft per min
* Always stay withing the limits of dive computer
* Make a safety stop in 5m /15ft

## No stop diving
* **No stop diving** is swimming directly to surface without unacceptable risk of decompression sickness
* **No stop limit** or **No decompression limit (NDL)** is the maximum time diver can spend at a depth and still ascend directly to surface
* If no stop limit is exceeded, one or more decompression stops must be taken
* Decompression stops are at specific depth for prescribed times
* In recreational diving, decompression stops are emergency procedures
* No stop times for two different computers can be different
* Computer constantly updates your remaining no stop time based on your dive profile – your actual depths, and your times at each depth – and the limits set by the decompression model
* **Multilevel diving** is possible with computers because it updates no stop time as you ascend
* Using a table, divers must abide by the no stop limit of the deepest depth

## Repetitive diving
* No stop limits are less after the first dive because of nitrogen from the first dive
* The nitrogen left in your body after a dive is called **residual nitrogen**
* A dive made while you still have residual nitrogen is called a **repetitive dive**
* Body nitrogen level return to normal after 12 hours and the next dive is considered **first dive** or **clean dive**
* A surface interval is the time you spend at the surface between two dives
* Because your dive computer tracks your personal theoretical nitrogen levels continuously during all your dives and all your surface intervals, you must use the same computer the entire diving day, on all dives, and not share it with another diver
* RDP addresses repetitive dive using three tables
	- The first table assigns a Pressure Group (as a letter) that represents the theoretical amount of residual nitrogen from your dive time and depth  
	- This Pressure Group represents having less theoretical residual nitrogen in the body.

	- The third table shows you no stop times for each depth adjusted for your Pressure Group at the start of the dive.

## Planning dives with computer 
* Four advantages of dive computers
	- Easier to use than tables
	- Help offset human errors
	- Gives more time underwater
	- Have other useful features, such as,
		* Measure water temperature
		* Download to dive log
* Dive computer information
	- No stop (no decompression) limits - for planning
	- Depth
	- Elapsed time
	- No stop time remaining
	- Ascent rate
	- Emergency decompression
	- Previous dive information
* Air supply commonly limits your dive – not your no stop time

## Diving with computer
* Six guidelines to follow when diving with computers
	1. Dive the plan
	2. Stay within computers limit
	3. Follow the most conservative computer
	4. Watch SPG - There are air-integrated computers
	5. Start with the deepest dive
	6. Ascend slowly
* In case of failure
	- Signal buddies and ascend, make a safety stop. Wait 12 hours or more before diving with another computer, or use a table
	- If you use two computers, dive using the backup computer
