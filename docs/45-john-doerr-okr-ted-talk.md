# OKRs

Objectives & key results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, they work for teams, they even work for individuals.

The objectives are what you want to have accomplished. The key results are how Iâ€™m going to get that done. 

# The why behind the goal

The teams must develop a shared sense of purpose that defines why they do what they do. Without the "why", the what and how of OKR might seem to be a meaningless exercise.

# The what 

Objectives are what needs to be achieved. They need to be:
* Significant
* Concrete
* Action oriented
* Inspirational

# The how's are the key results

Key results define how to achieve the objectives.

They need to be:
* Specific
* Time bound
* Aggressive but realistic
* Measurable and verifiable

# In life and in work

OKRs can be applied to life. What are your values, life's goals and how do you want to measure them? Write them down every quarter and evaluate your progress.
