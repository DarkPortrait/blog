## Introduction
This section is about planning the dive considering environment, personal limits and acquatic conditions.
## Dive environments and conditions
* Six conditions affect divers -
	1. Temperature
	2. Visibility
	3. Water movement
	4. Bottom composition
	5. Aquatic life
	6. Sunlight
### Temperature
* Climate and depth affects temperature
* It is important to base exposure protection on the temperature at the deepest part of the dive
### Visibility
* Defined by how far you can see a horizontal diver
* Ranges from 0 to 60m
* Factors affecting visibility
	1. Water current 
	2. Weather
	3. Plankton
	4. Nature and composition of particles in water - heavy particles sediment faster than lighter ones like mud and clay.
* Diving in reduced visibility
	1. Difficult to stay close to buddy
	2. Losing orientation while navigating
	3. Losing orientation while ascending or descending
* PADI Underwater Navigator and Search and Recovery Diver courses
* Diving in clear water - stay within 2 sec of buddies	
### Water movement
* Wave or current
* PADI Drift diving course
* Only swim against weak current
* Particularly at surface, swim perpendicular to the current
* Swim against the current to the diving location so you can return along the current
### Bottom composition
* Types -
	1. Silt/Mud
	2. Sand
	3. Rock
	4. Coral
	5. vegetation
### Sunlight
* Sunburn is the most common diving injury
* Sunscreens that do to affect aquatic life
### Fresh water vs salt water
* Less bouyant in fresh water
* Thermoclines are more distinct in fresh water
### Overhead environments
* Places where divers can swim into but cannot swim up to the surface
* Requires special training
* This course is open water diving - where the diver can directly go to surface
## Assessing conditions
* Assess conditions based on - 
	- The weather
	- The season
	- Water motion
	- Water appearance
	- Reports online and from other divers
	- Dives made at similar sites in the area
	- Experience
* Diver should make the decision to continue with the dive or not
## Dive with limits
* Don't exceed the limits set by diver's experience and training
* PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course
## Acquatic life
* Active vs passive interaction
### Hazardous organisms
* Stings or punctures -
	- Jelly fish
	- Sting rays
	- Sea urchins
	- Portuguese man-o-war
	- Lion fish and scorpion fish
	- Cone shells
	- Fire coral and other hydroids
	- Sea nettles
* Bites 
	- Moray eels
	- Barracida and other fish
	- Clawed lobsters/crabs
	- Trigger fish
	- Crocodilians
	- Some sharks
	- Snakes
	- Octopus
* Avoid wearing dangling, shiny jewelries 
* Avoid dead body parts - jellyfish or its body parts can sting even when dead
* Managing aquatic injury
	- Assure breathing
	- While diving in salt water, rinse stings with salt water
	- Don't rub stings
	- Vinegar on jellyfish, fire coral and other hydroid stings
	- Immerse stings from fish spines, scorpion/lion fish and stingrays in hot <50C/120F water
	- Use forcepts to remove spines
	- Treat bites like an wound
	- PADI Rescue Diver, Emergency First Response Primary Care (CPR) and Secondary Care (First Aid) courses
* Potentially aggressive animals
	- Watch and enjoy
	- This is rare
	- Don't swim towards
	- If uncomfortable, slowly swim away while keeping an eye on it
### Aquatic plant hazards
* Keep the kit streamlined
* Avoid dense areas
* Try swimming up instead of turning around if stuck
* Don't struggle, pull or twist
* Use knife or cutting tool if necessary
### Project AWARE
* Non-profit organization of scuba divers to protect the environment
## Diving from shore
* Typically, one puts on all equipment except masks, fins, snorkel and gloves, then conducts the safety check
* Keep your mask on the surface
* Walk till chest depth then the BCD can support, and wear the fin
* Wear the fin in the beginning and walk backwards
* Ascend or descend along the line from the surface float that divers can tow
## Shore diving through mild surf
* Some shore diving involves entering and exiting through breaking waves - surf
* Surf or the surf zome is the area in which waves break
* Waves break in shallow areas because the bottom stops the water, making the top "tip over" and break
* If waves break along a continuous line but with significant gap, its a channel or a rip current
* Surge and undertow - avoid
### Longshore current
* Waves approaching shore at an angle causes a current parallel to the shoreline

* Plan the exit considering the current
### Rip current
* Occurs when waves push water over a long obstruction, such as reef or sandbar
![Rip current](images/ripcurrent.svg)
_add the image_
* Can be very strong, so don't swim against it
* Establish bouyancy and swim parallel to shore until out of the current
### Upwelling
* Wind from shore can push surface water away bringing cooler deeper water to the top

### Tides
* Differences between high and low tides can be from unoticable to 6m/20ft in some areas
* Tide affects three environmental factors related to diving - 
	1. Currents
	2. Depth
	3. Visibility
* Tides are regional. Ask, research or look at tide tables

## Diving from boats - preparations
* Avoid seasickness
* Bow, stern, port, starboard, windward and leeward
## Diving from boats - procedures
* Roll calls
* Dive site briefing
* Recall signal and procedure
* Dive planning includes getting in and getting out of the water
* Stay where visible to crew of the boat
* Do not swim just below the surface
### Boat diving exit procedure
* Stay out from underneath divers climbing th ladder
* Hang on to the rope when there is a current and wait for turn
* Switch from snorkel to regulator while climbing
* Hand up equipments, like camera
* Hold ladder, remove fins
* Breathe on regulator and keep masks on until all the way up to the deck
### Boat diving with moderate current
* The trail line
* The swim line
* The moor/anchor line
### Dive boat not in sight
* Stay calm
* Use surface signalling devices
* Wait, or swim towards safety, if within reasonable distance, slowly
### Dive planning 
* Advance planning - deciding to go on the dive
	- Buddy
	- Dive site
	- Objective
	- Logistics
	- Check dive conditions - weather, surf, tides, etc.
* Preparation planning
	- Inspect gear
	- Cylinder filled
	- Recheck gear
	- Pack
* Last minute preparation
	- Recheck weather, surf, conditions
	- Create a safety contact
* Predive planning 
	- Actual dive plan
	- Evaluate the conditions
	- Decide whether to continue on diving
	- Agree on technique
		* where/how to enter
		* the course to follow
		* techniques during the dive
		* where/how to exit
	- Review signals and communication
	- Buddy separation procedures
	- Time, depth and air supply limits
	- Discuss emergency procedures
