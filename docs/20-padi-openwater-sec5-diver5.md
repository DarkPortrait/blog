## Gas Narcosis
* Many gases, including oxygen and nitrogen, cause an intoxicating effect under pressure. This is called gas narcosis. Signs and symptoms may include
	- Feeling intoxicated (drunk or “high”)
	- Loss of coordination
	- Slowed thinking
	- Slowed reactions
	- Inappropriate laughter
	- Depression
	- False sense of security
	- Ignoring or disregard for safety
	- Anxiety and/or panic (when under stress at depth)
* Gas narcosis is not thought to be harmful itself. The hazard is that it impairs the good judgment, clear thinking and timely responses you need to avoid and manage problems underwater
* Some gases – such as helium – are not narcotic, and tec divers breathe gas mixes with helium, which helps manage narcosis
* Gas narcosis is thought to be caused by increased dissolved gases in body tissues slowing nerve impulses that travel in the brain and nervous system
* Most divers usually begin to notice gas narcosis at a depth of approximately 30m / 100ft

## Navigating underwater
* Hold your compass so it’s relatively level (so the north needle can rotate) and so the lubber line is aligned with the centerline of your body
* Look over the compass, not down on it. This allows you to watch where you’re going while continuing to read it
