## Introduction
Another set of skills to learn as part of the course.

## Deep Water Entry
* Put on Scuba Kit at the Surface, Controlled Seated Entry
* Useful when diving from small boats without enough space to kit up
* Useful when entering from heights too great for giant stride
* Completely assemble your gear, check your SPG for enough air and be sure the cylinder valve is open
* Although you’re not wearing your kit, you go through the steps of your predive safety check
* If your BCD has integrated weights but will float adequately, then weights may be in place. For a separate weight system or if your gear won’t float, you will put the weights on in the water after putting on your scuba kit. Don’t enter the water without your BCD while wearing your weight system
* After you and your buddy(ies) are in your gear, finish the F – Final Check - step of your predive safety check, making sure that all buckles are secure, no hoses are trapped, nothing dangles and everything is where it should be
* In many instances, the controlled seated entry is suitable for getting into the water while wearing scuba gear. Partially inflate your BCD and breathe from your regulator before entering. As you turn to ease into the water, be sure your cylinder has cleared the platform edge.

## Helping a Tired Buddy
* Establish bouyancy for yourself and the diver who needs help
* Use the cylinder valve tow, with you and the diver floating face up, for short distances
* Use the tired diver push (modified tired-swimmer carry) for longer tows
* Swim at a slow, steady pace to the exit

## Neutral Buoyancy – Visual Reference Descents, Swimming and Ascents Near Sensitive Environments
* Combines neutral bouyancy skill with descending
* Control descent by controlling bouyancy
* Descent to 1-1.5m above the floor
* Learn to touch anything only intentionally

## No Mask Swim
* You may close your eyes if you have contacts, though you would keep them open if you really had to ascend without your mask
* Otherwise, keep your eyes open because you can see enough to be useful
* Swim with your buddy at least 15 metres/50 feet. Control your buoyancy, equalize your ears, etc. as you normally would. Your buddy will guide you (especially if you have your eyes closed)
* Concentrate on breathing through your mouth. Exhale through your nose if the water tickles it a bit
* After the swim, replace your mask and clear it

## Freeflow Regulator Breathing
* Depress the purge button to simulate free flow
* Hold the mouthpiece against your lips – don’t seal your mouth on it
* Allow excess air to escape; “sip” the air you need from the flow
* It may help to insert just one side of the mouthpiece into your mouth, with the other side out
* Practice for at least 30 seconds
* Check your SPG after practicing. You may be surprised how much air you used. This emphasizes the need to start your ascent immediately when breathing from a freeflowing regulator

## BCD Oral Inflation Underwater
* This is similar to orally inflating at the surface, except that you take each breath from your regulator and there is no need to kick up as you inhale
* Blow a third to half your breath into the BCD by pressing the deflator (exhaust) button while you blow in (and only then). You won’t put in as much air per breath as at the surface, because you’re only adjusting to become neutrally buoyant
* Let go of the deflator button while you’re not blowing in, so the BCD does not deflate
* Remember to blow a steady stream of bubbles when the regulator isn’t in your mouth
* Replace the regulator, clear it and resume breathing after blowing into your BCD. Wait a moment to see how your buoyancy has changed before making further adjustments
* Do not continue a dive with a malfunctioning low pressure inflator. Use oral inflation/normal deflation to maintain buoyancy control as you abort the dive
* Once neutrally buoyant, hover for a least a minute using breath control and small adjustments

## Skin Diving Skills
* Skin diving skills or free diving skills is diving with mask, fins and snorkel, but no scuba
* Breathe from your diaphragm before making a breath-hold dive. This is sometimes called “stomach breathing,” because your diaphragm is the muscle over your stomach. To do this, breathe so your stomach area expands.
* Hyperventilation (breathing deeper and/or more rapidly than normal) is no longer preferred as a breath-hold technique because it can lower carbon dioxide levels so low that your body can run out of oxygen before you get the urge to breathe. If done improperly, it can cause you to lose consciousness and drown
* Although some divers do this by limiting hyperventilation to only 2 or 3 deep breaths, it is better to breath-hold using relaxed diaphragm breathing, which allows you to hold your breath just as long (some evidence suggests longer)
* After returning to the surface, rest until your body restores normal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels
* Breathe normally from your diaphragm – a strong exhalation after surfacing from a long breath hold can cause you to become faint
* If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or feel tingling in your hands, arms or feet, stop diving down. Rest, relax and breathe at the surface
### Buddy Contact
* When skin diving, your buddy remains on the surface when you dive down, and vice versa
* Thee one-up, one-down technique allows your buddy to come to your aid if you need help
### Safety
* If skin diving deeper than 10 metres/30 feet and/or with breath-hold times longer than a minute interests you, see your instructor about specialized training

## Exit – Remove Scuba Kit in Water
* Begin by inflating your BCD to establish positive buoyancy
* Remove and hand up your weights, or attach them to a line. This may not be necessary if your kit will float with integrated weights still in it
* To exit the water without a ladder, push up and kick hard to lift your torso, then turn and sit on the swim step or boat side (as appropriate). Alternatively, lift yourself up, bend forward at the waist, and lower yourself so you’re face down on the deck/boat, then roll face up
* Sometimes you need to secure your kit to a gear line before exiting the water. This is especially true when there’s a current
