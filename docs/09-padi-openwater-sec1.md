## Introduction
* 5 sections relate to 5 key elements of training.
* PADI has courses to train for diving in new environments, for example - 
	1. exploring a wrekage
	2. diving with suits in cold water
## Section 1
### Being a diver 
* Every 10m/33ft, the water pressure increases by 1 bar/ata
* 1 bar = 1 atmospheric pressure
* For example, 40m/132ft, 5 bar
* Formula is = (depth / 10) + 1 bar
* Volume is inversely proportional to pressure
* **Squeeze** is when water pressure increases and air volume decreases in - 
	1. Ears
	2. Sinuses
	3. Masks
* **Equalize** pressure by pinching nose and blowing gently against it. 
* Equalization adds more air, maintiaining the volume
* Equalize gently and every meter
* Never use ear plug while diving because they make it hard to equalize
* During ascend, decreasing pressure can cause lung rupture injuries
* To avoid, breathe at all times and never hold your breathe
* **Reverse squeeze/block** can happen if expanding air is trapped
* Never dive with any congestion
* Breathe slowly and gently, never stop
* Bouyancy control device (BCD) helps control bouyancy
* With more depth, bouyancy decreases or diver becomes negatively bouyant
* BCD needs to be adjusted every few meters and tested for neutrality
* Descend and ascend at a slow and controllable rate
* In recreational diving, there is always a buddy
### Equipment 1
* Manufacturers make multiple models of gears, visit local PADI shop for guidance
* Primary consideration for gears -
	1. **Suitability** for the diver and the dive
	2. **Fit** is the size and adjustment for the diver
	3. **Comfort** means the diver can use it without issues
* Fit the mask strap above ears, over the crown of head
* Snorkel goes on the left side because regulator is on the right side
* Adjustible strap fins are often used with wet suit boots
* Hand fins are called webbed gloves
* DPV or Diver Propulsion Vehicles are scooters under water
#### Scuba Kit
* Scuba kit contains four items -
	1. BCD
		- Holds kit together
		- Allows for adjusting bouyancy
	2. Regulator
		- Delivers breathing air at surrounding pressure
		- Directs exhale air into the water
	3. Cyinder
		- Holds air in high pressure
	4. Weight system
		- Holds lead weight
		- Mechanism to drop in an emergency
* Its useful to buy package of all four items together
#### BCD
* Elements of BCD -
	1. Inflatable bladder
	2. Cylinder band and harness/jacket
	3. Low pressure inflator (LPI) mechanism - a button to inflate, deflate, manually inflate
	4. Overpressure / quick exhaust valves or Quick dump valves
	5. Weight system
* Options in BCD - 
	1. Bouyancy capacity or lift
	2. Pockets and D-rings
	3. Soulder quick release
* BCDs can be stylish
* BCD should have enough capacity to lift diver and equipments to surface
#### Regulators
* Parts of the regulator
	1. **Hub** - The first stage is the “hub” of your regulator. It is a simple and reliable device that supplies air to all the other components. It connects to the cylinder valve either by screwing into it, or with a yoke (clamp system). Either way, an o-ring forms the air-tight seal between the first stage and the cylinder valve. The first stage reduces cylinder pressure to an intermediate pressure, which is 7-10 bar/100-150 psi above the surrounding pressure.
	2. **Second stage** - You breathe from the second stage. It reduces the first stage intermediate pressure to the pressure around you and delivers air only when you inhale – on demand. It has one-way valves that vent your exhalation. The purge button lets you manually release air from your cylinder.
	3. **Alternate air source** - The alternate air source (or “octopus”) is an extra second stage you use for sharing air with a buddy should the need arise. The most popular alternate air source is a standard second stage on a longer hose. If needed, you pass it to your buddy to share air. Many are brightly colored so a buddy can locate them easily.
	4. **Low pressure inflator** - The low-pressure inflator (LPI) hose is the hose that supplies air to your BCD inflator. When diving with a dry suit, you have two. You use the second to add air to the suit as you descend.
	5. **SPG** - The Submersible Pressure Gauge (SPG) indicates the air pressure remaining in the cylinder. 
* Regulator options include - 
**Yoke or DIN** – The yoke system holds the first stage to the cylinder with a clamp system. With the DIN system, the regulator threads into the valve. The yoke system is older and more widely established, while the DIN system – which is growing in popularity – is widely used in Europe and Asia, and has a higher pressure rating. Your instructor or dive shop can advise you which system is the most popular where you are, but you can be ready for both systems.
To do this, a common option is to choose a DIN regulator with a yoke adapter, useable on either type valve.
**Adjustable second stage** – A knob allows small air flow adjustments; this option lets you keep the regulator breathing its best over the course of its maintenance cycle.

**Dive/Predive switch** – This switch reduces freeflow (air released without control) when the second stage isn’t in your mouth.

**Cold-water first stage** – In cooler climates, the first stage can freeze, resulting in a freeflow. Special cold-water regulators reduce the likelihood of this by surrounding the first stage with a special liquid.
* Regulators require professional overhaul as set by the manufacturers
#### Cylinders
* Have markings saying date of last visual inspection and other details
* Cylinders with an Enriched Air Nitrox (EANx) or Nitrox have more oxygen which let longer dive. PADI Enriched Air Diver course teaches how to use these.
* PADI TecRec program trains technical diving with advanced gears.
* Burst disk is safety device that releases air before cylinder fails.
* Cylinders require pressure testing every few years and annual visual testing.
#### Weight system
* Right distribution of weight is called trim. Trim is your orientation and balance in the water – generally, the desired trim is a natural horizontal swimming position with your feet parallel to the bottom or slightly elevated.
* Some BCDs have nonreleasable weight pockets. You use these for trim, but you should have enough releasable weight to assure positive buoyancy.
