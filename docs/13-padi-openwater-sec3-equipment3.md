## Introduction
Signaling devices, floats and dive flags.

## Surface signaling devices
* Diver should carry two while diving
	- audible
	- visual
* Make them a standard part of the scuba kit
* Examples 
	- whistles - normally attached with BCD inflator
	- low pressure horns - they use cylinder air and louder. should have the whistle if cylinder is empty
	- inflatable signal tube
	- signal mirrors
	- delayed surface marker buoys
	- signal lights and flashers
## Floats and flags
* Surface floats - carry with a reel or line caddy to avoid entanglement
* Flags are required by law in some places
* Traditional dive flag indicates divers below and boats should keep clear
* Alpha flag indicates that boat flying it has divers in the water and cannot maneuver
