## Prevention
* Recommended courses
	1. Advanced open water diver course 
	2. Rescue diver course
	3. Emergency first response primary and secondary care courses
	4. Emergency oxygen provider course
## Surface problem management - Responsive diver 
* Most diver-in-distress situations occur at the surface
* Establish positive buoyancy on the surface
	- inflate BCD, or
	- drop weights
* Common surface problems
	- overexertion
	- leg muscle cramps
	- choking on inhaled water
### Assisting a responsive diver at surface
* A diver who is breathing, alert and active is considered responsive.
* Two types 
	- in control / not panicked
	- out of control / panicked
* Four steps of helping 
	1. Establish buoyancy for yourself and the diver. If you must make contact to help, make yourself buoyant before doing so, then inflate the victim’s BCD and/or drop weights after you make contact.
	2. Calm the diver by reassuring, offering encouragement and asking the person to relax.
	3. Help the diver reestablish breathing control. 
	4. As necessary, assist the diver to the boat or shore. Even divers who don’t panic may need assistance due to leg cramps or being overly tired.
## Surface problem management - Unresponsive diver
* A diver may be unresponsive or unconscious for one of the following reasons
	- inhaling water
	- extreme fatigue
	- heart attack
	- lung over expansion injuries
	- panic
	- inefficient breathing
	- throat blockage
	- exhaustion, among others
* An unresponsive diver does not move and does not respond when tapped or spoken to.
* Confirm responsiveness if a diver floats without moving.
* A diver who surfaces alone, calls for help or shows signs of panic, then stops moving, should also be considered unresponsive until you confirm otherwise.
### Assisting unresponsive diver at surface
* Four steps
	1. Establish buoyancy
	2. Call of help
	3. Check for breathing
	4. Continue rescue breathing during the tow
## Underwater problem management
* Three ways to avoid -
	1. Relax when diving
	2. Plan air usage and monitor closely
	3. Dive withing limits of experience and training
### Overexertion
* Symptoms -
	- feeling of air starvation
	- exhausted
* Steps - 
	- Signal “stop” or “hold” and indicate that you need to rest.
	- Continue at a reduced pace after you recover.
	- If you can’t return to a relaxed state, end the dive.
	- If conditions are adding to overexertion, it may be best to abort the dive.
### Freeflowing regulator
* If regulators fail, they release air continuously (called a freeflow).
* Do not seal your mouth on the mouthpiece.
* Hold the second stage in your hand and press the mouthpiece outside your lips. Let the excess air escape freely. You may insert only one end of the mouthpiece into your mouth if it helps.
* Breathe the air you need by “sipping” it,
### Entanglement
* Prevent by -
	- Moving slowly
	- Watching where you are going
	- Keeping equipment streamlined
* Do not turn or twist.
* Extreme cases might require having to slip out of scuba kit and putting it back on.
### Running low / out of air underwater
* Ascend
* Ascending with enough air allows you to control your ascent and to make a safety stop.
* Four options -
	1. **Make a normal ascent**
		- Do this if you’re very low on air (you feel some breathing resistance), but your cylinder isn’t completely empty.
		- As you ascend, you can get more air from your cylinder, because the surrounding water pressure decreases.
		- Breathe lightly (but continuously) and make a controlled, continuous ascent to the surface.
		- Do not attempt a safety stop.
	2. **Ascend using an alternate air source**
		- Think of this as your best, all around choice when you have an alternate air source immediately available.
		- During your predive safety check, confirm what alternate air sources your buddies have and how to secure them. Test breathe your alternate air source(s).
		- To use an alternate air source supplied by a buddy, you need to stay close to your buddy(ies).
	3. **Controlled Emergency Swimming Ascent (CESA)**
		- This is the best choice if you were completely out of air, no deeper than approximately 6 to 9 metres/20 to 30 feet, the surface is closer than your buddy(ies) or another diver, and you have no other alternate air source.
		- Simply look up and swim to the surface making a continuous “ahhhhh” sound into your regulator. The “ahhhhh” sound assures that you exhale expanding gas, which is necessary to avoid lung overexpansion injury.
		- Leave all your gear in place and keep the regulator in your mouth. Do not drop your weights to start your ascent.
		- Ascend at a safe rate. The ascent gets easier as you ascend because air expanding in your BCD increases your buoyancy. Vent air as needed to maintain a proper rate.
	4. **Bouyant Emergency Ascent**
		- Use this option when you are too far from your buddy(ies) or another diver, have no other alternate air source and are so deep that you doubt you can reach the surface any other way.
		- You make a buoyant emergency ascent exactly like a Controlled Emergency Swimming Ascent, except you ditch your weights and exceed a safe rate.
		- Again, look up and make the “ahhhhh” sound as you ascend.
		- Because you exceed a safe rate, this method has more risk than the other options (which is why it is your last choice), but is obviously better than staying on the bottom without air.
		- As you near the surface, you can flare out your arms and legs to create drag and slow your ascent.
* You can’t inflate your BCD by using the low-pressure inflator, because you have an empty cylinder. Instead, inflate your BCD orally and/or drop your weights.
### Assisting unresponsive diver underwater
* Priority is to get the diver to surface
* Procedure -
	1. Swim the diver to the surface. If necessary, use the diver’s BCD and/or drop weights to make the victim buoyant.
	1. If the diver’s regulator is in the mouth, hold it there. If it is not, don’t waste time trying to replace it.
	1. Ascend at a safe rate. If the diver’s buoyancy becomes too great for a safe ascent rate, let the victim go. Finish a safe ascent and resume the rescue at the surface. Keep yourself safe. You can’t help someone else if you have troubles of your own.
	1. At the surface, follow the priorities and procedures for an unresponsive diver at the surface.
## First responded care for diving-related emergencies
* A diver who is or was unresponsive should be considered serious medical emergencies.
* Drowning or otherwise becoming unresponsive underwater, pressure-related injuries and medical conditions not directly related to diving (like heart attack) can cause these signs (what you observe) and symptoms (what the victim feels):
	- difficulty breathing
	- unconsciousness
	- unclear thinking
	- visual problems
	- paralysis
	- chest pain
	- lowered alertness
	- cardiac and respiratory arrest
### Assisting unresponsive diver out of water
* General steps
	- Keep the diver’s airway open and check for breathing.
	- Provide rescue breathing or CPR as necessary.
		* Do not use abdominal thrusts unless you are unable to provide rescue breathing due to a suspected obstruction.
	 	* Inhaled water, if present, does not prevent rescue breaths. You don’t have to try to clear it.
	- If the diver is unresponsive but breathing, keep the diver lying level on the left side (recovery position). This position is not more important than transporting the diver to safety or providing rescue breaths or CPR if necessary.
	- Check the diver’s breathing frequently.
	- If the diver has regained responsiveness, keep the diver lying down comfortably.
	- Administer emergency oxygen as soon as possible.
	- Keep the diver still and maintain a normal body temperature by protecting from heat or cold.
	- Continue to provide care until emergency medical care arrives.
	- If you can’t accompany the diver to medical care, write down as much background information as possible about the individual and the dive, and attach it to the diver in a conspicuous place.
		* Provide only information relevant to care, such as the dive profile, emergency care provided, emergency contact information, and any known medical conditions.
		* Write only facts. Do not speculate or guess – bad information is worse than no information.
* Some conditions, such as drowning, can have delayed serious, potentially fatal, consequences hours after the incident.
