## Remove and Replace the Scuba Kit Underwater
* This is one of the few skills in which it may be important to be negatively buoyant, s
* you could kneel on the bottom if necessary
* In open water, if possible, do this on insensitive bottom away from fragile aquati
* life. If dealing with entanglement or another safety situation, however, you probably hav
* no choice about where you do it
* With a weight-integrated BCD with a small or moderate amount of weight, or using a BCD without integrated weights, completely deflate your BCD and kneel on the bottom with your left knee down and your right knee up. If you have a lot of weight (while wearing a dry suit, for example), you may want enough air in the BCD so that it is not too negative to handle once you remove it
* Remove the BCD starting with your left arm, so the regulator stays in your mouth
* Keep the kit upright and do not let go of it. Stand it on your right knee. You may keep your right arm partially through the harness for control
* To keep stable on the bottom with weight-integrated BCDs, keep the unit close and positioned so that you don’t float away from it. Keeping it on your knee is one effective way to do this
* Start with the right arm when you put it back on, so the regulator stays in your mouth
* Before fastening the straps, check to be sure you won’t trap any hoses or accessories

## Remove and Replace Weight System Underwater
* The main reasons for removing and replacing your weight system underwater are to make trim adjustments, to remove weight you can retrieve later, to replace a dislodged weight pouch or to untwist a weight belt
* This is the other skill in which it often helps to be negatively buoyant (again, on insensitive bottom), though it may not be necessary, depending upon your weight system and the amount of weight you’re wearing
* Deflate your BCD and kneel
* Remove the weight pocket and rest it on your knee. If using a weight belt, release it and pull it from behind your back with the buckle (left side) free, and drape it over your knee
* Resting the weight on your knee helps you keep your balance
* Your instructor will show you the technique(s) suited to your kit

## Descents and Ascents Without Reference
* Equalize regularly as you descend
* Control your buoyancy. Slow descents and ascents are easier to control
* When ascending, watch your computer and be sure you ascend within its ascent rate
* When you ascend, make a safety stop by hovering in midwater at 5 metres/15 feet
* Practice this about half way to the surface in confined water
* If you need to navigate while descending and/or ascending, one buddy navigates while the other controls the depth and the descent/ascent rate
