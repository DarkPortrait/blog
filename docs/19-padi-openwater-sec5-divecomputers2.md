## Planning a Minimum Surface Interval
* Planning a repetitive dive for a specific depth and time requires finding a minimum surface interval
* This is determining how long to wait after the first dive to have the no stop time you want at the planned depth of the repetitive dive
* 3 ways to find a minimum surface interval with a computer: wait and check, use the dive computer plan mode and use a tablet/smartphone

## Flying After Diving and Altitude Diving
* As of Sep 2020, the dive medical community’s recommendations for flying after diving are:
* For no stop dives
	- Single dives (no repetitive dive) – A minimum preflight surface interval of 12 hours is suggested.
	- Repetitive dives or multiday dives (diving every day for several days in a row) – A minimum preflight surface interval of 18 hours is suggested.
* Dives requiring emergency decompression stops:
	- A minimum preflight surface interval greater than 18 hours is suggested.
* These recommendations are based on a cabin altitude pressure range of 600-2400 metres/2000-8000 fee
* Need to use altitude diving procedures if diving at an altitude of 300 metres/1000 feet or higher
* Dive computer might have settings to adjust for high altitude diving

## Cold and/or Strenuous Dives
* Can dissolve more than usual levels of nitrogen in body tissue
* Plan cold/strenuous dives as though they are 4 metres/10 feet deeper than their actual depth
* Safety stops are recommended at the end of all dives, but they’re especially wise after a cold and/or strenuous dive

## Emergency Decompression Stops
* Safety stops keep you well within limits, whereas emergency decompression stops return you from outside limits
* In recreational diving, required emergency decompression stops are emergency situations only. They mean you either failed to monitor your dive computer (or timer and depth gauge), or something forced you to overstay your time at depth
* If you don’t have enough air to complete an emergency decompression stop, stop as long as you can, but save enough air to surface and exit safely
* If you didn’t complete the entire emergency decompression stop (or accidentally skipped it altogether), after ascending, relax, breathe 100 percent emergency oxygen if available and monitor yourself for decompression sickness symptoms. Don’t dive again for at least 24 hours

## First Aid and Treatment for Decompression Illness
* The term **decompression illness (DCI)** is used to describe both lung overexpansion injuries and decompression sickness
* Steps to help in DCI:
	- The diver should stop all diving
	- Check for breathing. Provide CPR as needed
	- Contact emergency medical care. Some areas have diver emergency services for consultation and to coordinate with local medical services
	- Keep the diver lying down and provide emergency oxygen
	- Monitor the diver and take steps to prevent shock
	- If the diver is unresponsive but breathing normally, lay the diver level, left side down, head supported, breathing oxygen
	- Continue this care until emergency medical personnel arrive
* Almost all cases of decompression illness require treatment in a recompression chamber
