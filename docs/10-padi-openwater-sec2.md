## Being a diver 2

### Seeing and hearing
* Things appear closer than they are
* Colors are lost at different depths  
![Color spectrum under water](images/color-water-depth.svg)
* Hard to tell the direction of sound under water
* Sound travels 4x speed of air
### Swimming and moving
* Relax, don't rush
* Trim properly for streamlined swim
### Staying warm
* Dry suit vs wet suit
* Hypothermia - chill and shivering
* When uncomfortable, end the dive
### Breathing underwater
* Air is denser underwater, takes time to breathe
* **Dead Air Space** is air filled spaces out of lungs, where respiration isnt happening. 
* The first air you inhale (“dead” air) with each breath is the air from your last exhalation, so it is higher in carbon dioxide.
* Breathing slowly and deeply reduces the proportion of dead air in each breath.
* **Airway control** is the skill of breathing past the residual water in regulator / snorkel
	* Inhale slowly
	* Tough tongue to the roof to stop water below
	* Look a bit downward
* Overexertion symptoms
	* Fatigue
	* Labored breathing
	* A feeling of suffocation or air starvation
	* Weakness
	* Anxiety
	* Headache
	* Muscle cramping
	* A tendency to panic
* Always breath slowly and deeply. If not, stop to relax or abort dive.
* Peak Performance Buoyancy course trains about controlling bouyancy using center to gravity, center of bouyancy, streamlined body position and breathing techniques.
### Managing air pressure with buddy
* Calculate turn pressure - the SPG pressure at which divers turn around
### Swimming at the surface
* Use mask, snorkel
### Descent in open water
* Five steps of descent
	1. Confirm that your buddies are ready.
	2. Orient yourselves to something at the surface or underwater, such as the boat or a landmark.
	3. Switch from your snorkel to your regulator.
	4. Check, and if necessary activate, your dive computer or timer. 
	5. Signal “descend” and, with your buddies, slowly deflate your BCD.
* Begin equalizing immediately, as soon as your head goes underwater.
* You descend faster as you go deeper. Add to BCD to compensate, in small ammounts and frequently.
* Ideally, you rech target depth with neutral bouyancy
### Ascent in open water
* Five steps of ascent
	1. Signal “up” and confirm that your buddies are ready.
	2. Check your dive computer to be sure you’re within its limits.
	3. Look up and hold up your BCD deflator hose. Do not add air to your BCD. If you’re properly weighted and neutrally buoyant, you only need to start swimming up gently.
	4. Ascend slowly – no faster than your dive computer’s maximum rate.
		* Release air expanding in your BCD to control your buoyancy so you don’t start to rise too fast.
		* Ascend no faster than 3 metres/10 feet each 10 seconds
	5. Look up and turn as you ascend
* Ascend without reference and navigating 
	* One common technique is for one buddy to navigate while the other controls the ascent. 
* **Safety stops** are normal part of ascend for prudent divers.
	* It is the pause in ascent between 6 metres/20 feet and 3 metres/10 feet (commonly 5 metres/15 feet) for three to five minutes.
	* Helps avoid decompression sickness (DCS)
* Keep your hand up as you break the surface. 
* Continue to breathe from your regulator as you inflate your BCD. After making sure you’re floating comfortably, switch to your snorkel.

## Skills as diver 2
### Deep water entry - giant stride
* Enter the water fully equipped with a partially inflated BCD.
* Remember to breathe from your regulator and hold it, and your mask, as you enter. Hold them until you’re stable on the surface.
* Look straight ahead and step in – don’t jump.
* Signal that you’re “okay” and clear the entry area.
* Switch to your snorkel.
### Weight check
* You should float at eye level with an empty BCD and holding a normal breath. When you exhale, you should slowly sink.
* After adjusting so you float at eye level, add two kilograms/five pounds if you checked with a full cylinder. This is because the air in it has weight, so you will become lighter as you use up your air. Two kilograms/five pounds adjusts for the air in a typical cylinder.
### Dealing with loose cylinder band
* If it comes loose while exiting, it is often simplest to ease back into the water, slip out of the kit and then lift or carry it out of the water by the cylinder valve.
* If it comes loose before the dive, help the diver remove the scuba kit for retightening.
* If it comes loose during a dive, it is not usually an emergency, because the cylinder tends to stay with the diver. Signal the affected diver so you can tighten it, or signal your buddy if it is your cylinder band that’s loose.
### Snorkel/Regulator exchange
* Swap, clear water, breath slowly.
* Practice until effortless.
### Neutral bouyancy
* Fin pivot - pivot up fin when inhaling, drop when exhaling
* Adjust by adding 
### Mask removal, replacement and no mask breathing
* Clear a fully flooded mask just as you do a partially flooded one; you just exhale a little longer.
* Train for a minute without mask to simulate the time of getting back to surface.
### Disconnect Low-pressure Inflator
* An unlikely but possible malfunction is for your BCD (or dry suit) inflator to stick. Your response is to disconnect the hose supplying air to it
* If disconnecting is taking time, get in a vertical position and hold open the exhaust valve while continuing to disconnect the inflator hose.
* For colder water diving, you can get low-pressure hoses with oversized release fittings to make this easier while wearing gloves.
### Air (Gas) Depletion exercise
This exercise lets you experience what it feels like to run out of air, which is part of learning to respond appropriately.
### Air awareness and managin air supply
* Besides knowing how to read your SPG and plan your air use, develop the habit of knowing approximately how much air you have at all times.
* Should be able to answer within 20 bar/300 psi without rechecking.
### Deep water exit
* Switch back to your regulator before exiting.
