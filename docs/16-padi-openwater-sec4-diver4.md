## Health and fitness
* Maintain a general level of physical fitness - meaning adequate fitness plus physical reserve
* Keep immunization current - especially tetanus and typhoid
* Well balanced diet and rest well before diving
* Regular physical examination. The RSTC Medical Statement provides guidelines developed by dive medical experts that any physician can use to conduct dive physicals. Your instructor will give you this form, or you can download it from padi.com
* Heart health is critical to avoid heart attack during diving
* Avoid alcohol and tobacco before diving
* Use prescription drugs with caution
* Menstruation not a problem
* Avoid diving while pregnancy
* If you feel ill before a dive, cancel it

## Staying current and active diver
* Online forums including PADI Club, dive magazines
* PADI ReActivate program to review training after a break longer than 6 months
* Continue training

## The air your breathe
* Four issues that relate to the composition of air:
	- Oxygen toxicity
	- Contaminated air
	- Decompression sickness
	- Gas narcosis
* Enriched air nitrox (EANx), also called Nitrox, is any blend of O2 and N with 22%+ O2
* Common blends in recreational diving are 32% and 36% O2
* Tec divers can use even more % of O2
* Increasing the oxygen content and decreasing the nitrogen content has advantages and disadvantages with respect to decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity problems
* PADI enriched air diver course, or instructor may train during the open water diver course

## Oxygen issues
* Under high pressure, oxygen is toxic
* If a gas has oxygen in it, oxygen toxicity can result from breathing it deeper than a specific depth
* The higher the oxygen content, the shallower the limit for using it while diving
* High oxygen percentages can also create some fire/combustion risks with respect to the equipment with which it must be used
* To avoid oxygen toxicity when diving with air, don’t exceed the maximum depth for recreational diving (40 metres/130 feet).
* Fire/combustion problems aren’t issues when using air with standard scuba equipment.
* Recreational divers don’t use 100 percent oxygen, but tec divers often do (shallower than 6 metres/20 feet, as part of their ascent procedures)
* Rebreather divers use them and trained in the PADI Rebreather diver course

## Contaminated air
* Compressors for filling cylinders use valves to keep away impurities
* Trace amount of CO or Oil vapor is harmless on ground but can be toxic when breathed under pressure
* Possible causes 
	- Getting cylinder filled at improper source
	- Improper maintenance of filling system
	- More contaminant in the source than the filters can keep out
* Symptoms that the air could be contaminated
	- Headache
	- Nausea
	- Dizziness
	- Unconsciousness/unresponsiveness
	- Cherry-red lips/fongernail beds (though this is difficult to see underwater)
* Actions to take
	- give fresh air
	- emergency oxygen
	- CPR
	- emergency medical care provider

## Decompression Sickness
* The two primary factors affecting **Nitrogen absorption** are dive depth and time
* Nitrogen dissolves in body tissue due to the pressure (depth)
* As you ascend, the nitrogen is released by body tissue, carried by blood to lungs for exhaling
* If the amount of excess nitrogen is within accepted limits, your body normally gets rid of it harmlessly over the next several hour
* Use dive compuers or dive tables like RDP or eRDP-ML to stay withi acceptable nitrogen limits
* If the excess nitrogen in your body tissues is too high, when you ascend and surface, the nitrogen may come out of solution faster than your body can eliminate it. This can cause nitrogen bubbles to form within your blood and body tissues, much like bubbles form when you open a soda bottle and release the pressure
* Bubbles forming in the body cause a very serious medical condition called **decompression sickness**, also called DCS or "the bends"
* The signs and symptoms of DCS depend upon where bubbles form in the body. They include:
	- Paralysis
	- Dizziness
	- Tingling
	- Joint and limb pain
	- Shock
	- Numbness
	- Difficulty breathing
	- Weakness and prolonged fatigue
	- In severe cases, unconsciousness and death
* DCS signs and symptoms may be clear and obvious, but they may also be subtle, like a mild to moderate, dull ache (often, but not necessarily, in the joints), mild to moderate tingling or numbness, weakness and prolonged fatigue
* They usually occur 15 minutes to 12 hours after a dive, though they can occur before surfacing, and they can occur after 12 hours
* Physiologists think that when present, the following secondary factors can contribute to developing DCS:
	- Fatigue
	- Dehydration
	- Cold
	- Poor fitness/high body fat
	- Illness
	- Injuries
	- Age
	- Alcohol consumption before or after a dive
	- Vigorous exercise before, during or immediately after the dive
